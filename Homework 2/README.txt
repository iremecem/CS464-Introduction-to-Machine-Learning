Required Python Version: v3.8.2

Make sure that pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, 
PIL, random and os libraries are installed.
If they are not installed, execute below commands in terminal:
    $ pip3 install pandas
    $ pip3 install numpy
    $ pip3 install matplotlib
    $ pip3 install seaborn
    $ pip3 install PIL
    $ pip3 install random
    $ pip3 install os

After making sure all libraries necessary to run the program in your computer,
Make sure following files are in the working directory:
    digits.csv
    question-2-features.csv
    question-2-labels.csv
    question-3-features-test.csv
    question-3-features-train.csv
    question-3-labels-test.csv
    question-3-labels-train.csv
    question_1.py
    question_2.py
    question_3.py

After making sure all libraries necessary to run the program in your 
computer, and all of mentioned files are in current working directory
simply call the below command in terminal within the directory where the
main.py file is located
    $ python3 main.py

When executing the question scripts, plots and figures automatically shown
on the screen in a different window, to continue executing, you need to
close corresponding windows, then the program will automatically continue.

If you see a message in the terminal as "{Apple/Windows}PersistenceIgnoreState: 
Existing state will not be touched. New state will be written to (null)",
don't worry, it is a bug from matplotlib itself and is not related to
a problem stemming from the executed script.
